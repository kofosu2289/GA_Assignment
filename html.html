        <h3>Kenneth Ofosu</h3>
        <p>Hello, all, my name is Kenneth. I am 29 years old, and I live in Brooklyn, New York. I was born and raised in Manhattan, and left
          New York at the age of 19 to join the Army, but not before trying college for a year. I attended St. John's University from August
          2006 to May 2007 to study physics. I joined the Army in December 2008 as a combat medic and returned in September 2014 I consider myself a fairly simple man, 
          but i have a great deal of hobbies and interests that span a variety of areas, such as drumming and web development. I am hoping
        that completing an immersive program at General Assembly will give me the tools I need to break into the field of software engineering.</p>
